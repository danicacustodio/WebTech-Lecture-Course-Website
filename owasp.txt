OWASP
The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) is an
open community dedicated to enabling organizations to
develop, purchase, and maintain applications and APIs that
can be trusted.
The OWASP Top 10 is a powerful awareness document for web application security. 
It represents a broad consensus about the most critical security risks 
to web applications. Project members include a variety of security experts 
from around the world who have shared their expertise to produce this list.
