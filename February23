      ATTRIBUTES - Attributes are made up of two parts: a name and a value
                  It is used to define the characteristics of an HTML element and is placed inside the element's opening tag.
						
						The name is the property you want to set. For example, the paragraph <p> element in the example 
						carries an attribute whose name is color, which you can use to change the font color of paragraph 
						on the page.

						The value is what you want the value of the property to be set and always put within quotations. 
					
							Example: <font color = "blue "> This text will appear blue.</font>
							
				Global Attributes - are attributes that can be used or common to any HTML element, but have no effect on some
                    				HTML elements.
