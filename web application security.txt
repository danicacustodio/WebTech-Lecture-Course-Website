Web application security

Web application security is the process of securing confidential data stored online 
from unauthorized access and modification. 
This is accomplished by enforcing stringent policy measures. 
Security threats can compromise the data stored by an organization is hackers with malicious intentions 
try to gain access to sensitive information.

The aim of Web application security is to identify the following:
	Critical assets of the organization
	Genuine users who may access the data
	Level of access provided to each user
	Various vulnerabilities that may exist in the application
	Data criticality and risk analysis on data exposure
	Appropriate remediation measures

Web application security aims to address and fulfill the four conditions of 
security, also referred to as principles of security:
	Confidentiality: States that the sensitive data stored in the Web 
		application should not be exposed under any circumstances.
	Integrity: States that the data contained in the Web application is 
		consistent and is not modified by an unauthorized user.
	Availability: States that the Web application should be accessible to the 
		genuine user within a specified period of time depending on the request.
	Nonrepudiation: States that the genuine user cannot deny modifying the 
		data contained in the Web application and that the Web application can 
		prove its identity to the genuine user.
		
The process of security analysis runs parallel with Web application development. 
The group of programmers and developers who are responsible for code development 
are also responsible for the execution of various strategies, 
post-risk analysis, mitigation and monitoring.
