<h2>What is World Wide Web(WWW)?</h2>
<p>The World Wide Web (www) is combination of all resources and users on the Internet that are using the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP).
It is the universe of network accessible information, and embodiment of human knowledge.
The Web, as it's commonly known, is often confused with the internet.
Although the two are intricately connected, they are different things.
The internet is, as its name implies, a network- a vast, global network that incorporates a multitude of lesser networks.
As such, the internet consists of supporting infrastructure and other technologies.
In contrast, the Web is a communications model that, through HTTP, enables the exchange of information over the internet.
He is a British computer scientist, Born in London and his parents were computer scientists who worked on the earliest computers.
He Graduated from Oxford University as an Software Engineer.</p>

<h3>History of World Wide Web</h3>
<p>World Wide Web was ivented by Sir Tim-Berners Lee in 1989.
In March 1989, Tim laid out his vision for what would become the web in a document called "Information Management"
then He began work using a Next computer, one of Steve Jobsâ€™ early products.

By October of 1990, Tim had written the three fundamental technologies that remain foundation of today's web.
	<ul>
	<li>HTML(HyperText Markup Language)</li>
	<dd>- The markup language for the web</dd>
	<li>URI(Uniform Resource Identifier)</li>
	<dd>- A kind of "address" that is unique and used to identify each resource on the web.</dd>
	<dd>It is also commonly called a URL</dd>
	<li>HTTP(Hypertxt Transfer Protocol)
	<dd>- Allows for the retrieval of linked resources from across the web.</dd>
	</ul>
Tim also wrote the first web page editor/browser ("WorldWideWeb.app") and the first web server ("httpd").
By the end of 1990, the first web page was served on the open internet,
and in 1991, people outside of CERN were invited to join the new web community.
As the web began to grow, Tim realised that its true potential would only be unleashed if anyone,
anywhere could use it without paying a fee or having to as for permission.

<h3>What is HTTP(Hypertext Transfer Protocol)?</h3>
<p>Hypertext Transfer Protocol are set of rules for transferring files such as Images, Sound, Videos, Text, 
and more multimedia Files on the World Wide Web.
HTTP is an application that runs on top of the TCP/IP suite of protocols.
Web Server Machine contains, in addition to the Web page files it can server, 
an HTTP daemon a program that is design to wait for HTTP request to be handled when that arrive. 
The  Web browser is a HTTP client, sending request to the server machine. 
If the browser user enters the files requests by either opening a Web file or clicking a link, the browser builds 
and HTTP request and send it to the IP Address indicated by the URL. 
The HTTP daemon receives the request and sends back the requested file or files associated with the request.
</p>
<section id="HTTPhistory">
<h2>Versions of HTTP</h2>
<h3>HTTP 1.0(RFC 1945) MAY 1996</h3>
<p>The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-level
   protocol with the lightness and speed necessary for distributed,
   collaborative, hypermedia information systems. It is a generic,
   stateless, object-oriented protocol which can be used for many tasks,
   such as name servers and distributed object management systems,
   through extension of its request methods (commands). A feature of
   HTTP is the typing of data representation, allowing systems to be
   built independently of the data being transferred.</p>
<h3>HTTP 1.1 (RFC 2616) June 1999</h3>
<p>The Hypertext Transfer Protocol is an application-level protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information systems. 
It is a generic, stateless, protocol which can be used for many tasks beyond its use for hypertext, such as name servers 
and distributed object management systems, through extension of its request methods, error codes and headers. 
A feature of HTTP is the typing and negotiation of data representation, allowing systems 
to be built independently of the data being transferred.</p>
<h3>HTTP 2.0 (RFC 7540) May 2015</h3>
<p>ol, referred to as HTTP
   version 2.  HTTP/2 enables a more efficient use of network
   resources and a reduced perception of latency by introducing header
   field compression and allowing multiple concurrent exchanges on the
   same connection.  It also introduces unsolicited push of
   representations from servers to clients.
   This specification is an alternative to, but does not obsolete, the
   HTTP/1.1 message syntax.  HTTP's existing semantics remain unchanged.</p>

<section id="hra">
<h2>HTTP Resources Addressing</h2>
	<p>are identified using URI(Uniform Resources Indetifiers).
	Unlike web data formats, where HTML is an important one, but not the only one, and web protocols,
	where HTTP has a similar status, there is only one Web naming/addressing technology
URI:are short strings that identify resources in the web like documents, images, downloadable files, services, and other resources.
They make resources available under a variety of naming schemes and access methods such as HTTP, FTP, and Internet mail addressable.</p>
<ul>
	<li>scheme(http/https) - URI that is compliant to HTTP</li>
	<li> authority - user information or authentication credentials </li>
	<li> host - domain name (resolved to an IP address using DNS) of the server where the resource resides (or will be created) </li>
			<dd> every domain name consists an IP address (like contacts in phone) </dd>
		<dt> port number</dt>
	<li> path to resource (resolved relative to the document root ont the server) </li>
		<dd> may refer to a static or dynamic resource </dd>
	<li> query - typically provided as key-value pairs with ampersand(&) separators between key/value pairs </li>
		<dd> may be URL-encoded (% sign) </dd>
</section>
<section id="hr">
<h2>HTTP Request</h2>
	<p>Whenever your web browser fetches a file  from a web server, it does so using HTTP.
	Your computer sends a request for some file, and the web server sends back a response.
	That request which your computer sends to the web server contains all sorts of  interesting information. </p>
<dl>
<dt> Request Method </dt>
<dd> - to indicate the desired action to be performed for a given resource. </dd>

	<dt> Request Target </dt><dd> - an inbound connection is obtained, the client sends an HTTP request message  with a request-target derived from the target URI. </dd>
<ul>
<li> origin-from </li>
<dd> - a client must send only the absolute path and query components of the target URI as the request-target. </dd>

<li> absolute-form </li>
<dd>- a client MUST send the target URI in absolute-form as the request-target.</dd>

<li> asterisk-form </li>
<dd> - When a client wishes to request OPTIONS for the server as a whole, as opposed to a specific named resource of that server, the client must send only "*" as the request-target. </dd>
</ul>
</dl>

	<li> Request Protocol Version </li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="hrl">
<h2> HTTP Request Line </h2>
	<ul><li> Request Line (CRLF - terminated line consisting of 3 space separated values)</li>
	</ul>
</section>
<section id="hrm">
<h2> HTTP Request Methods </h2>
	<h3> Standard Methods </h3>
<p> - This allows user agents to represent other methods, such as POST, PUT and DELETE, in a special way, so that the user is made aware of the fact that a possibly unsafe action is being requested.</p>
<ul>
<li>GET</li>
<dd> simply fetch data </dd>
<li>HEAD</li>
<dd> same as GET method but retrieve only the METADATA (Header) </dd>
<li>POST</li>
<dd> Data will be re-submitted (the browser should alert the user that the data are about to be re-submitted) </dd>
<dd> enclosed as a body </dd>
<dd> safer than Get </dd>
<li>PUT</li>
<dd> creates/replace the state of the target resource </dd>
<dd> Uploads a representation of the specified URI</dd>
<li>DELETE</li>
<dd> Deletes the specified resource </dd>
<li>OPTIONS</li>
<dd> the purpose is to let the user know what to do and what can only be done </dd>
<dd> shows allowed HTTP request methods (Standard) </dd>
<li>TRACE</li>
<dd> repeats the request done </dd>
<dd> used to invoke a remote, application-layer loop- back of the request message. </dd>
<li>CONNECT</li>
<dd> Converts the request connection to a transparent TCP/IP tunnel </dd>
</ul>

	<h3> Safe Methods </h3>
<p> methods that can be cached, prefetched without any repercussions to the resource. </p>
<ul>
<li>GET</li>
<li>HEAD</li>
<li>OPTIONS</li>
</ul>

	<h3> Idempotent Methods </h3>
<p> the expectation is the same even if PUT and DELETE is used </p>
<ul>
<li>GET</li>
<li>HEAD</li>
<li>PUT</li>
<li>DELETE</li>
<li>OPTIONS</li>
</ul>

	<H3> Cacheable Methods </H3>
<p> response isallowed to be stored for future use </p>
<ul>
<li>GET</li>
<li>HEAD</li>
</ul>

<h2> HTTP Response </h2>
<section id="sc">
<h3> HTTP Status Codes </h3>
<p> The Status-Code element is a 3-digit integer result code of the attempt to understand and satisfy the request.</p>
<p>1xx: Informational - Request received, continuing process

<br/>2xx: Success - The action was successfully received, understood, and accepted

<br/>3xx: Redirection - Further action must be taken in order to complete the request

<br/>4xx: Client Error - The request contains bad syntax or cannot be fulfilled

<br/>5xx: Server Error - The server failed to fulfill an apparently valid request </p>
</section>
<h3> STATUS LINE </h3>
<p> Zero or more header indicating the end of the header fields. Optionally a message-body. </p>
